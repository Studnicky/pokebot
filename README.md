[Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md)

* Find new scripts with:
>   `npm search hubot-scripts ______`

####    Troubleshooting

If you're having issues, adding this line to your bin/hubot or Heroku .env file to see dev debug info:
>   `export HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL="debug"`

## Running Locally via terminal

* Clone the repospity:
>   `git clone git@github.com:Studnicky/pokebot.git && cd pokebot`

* Set [environment variables](#configuration):
>   `HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL = (your heroku app url)`

>	`HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN = (your slack API token)`

* Install prereq's _(requires npm and node to be installed globally)_
>   `npm install`

* To test locally in terminal, start pokebot with gulp:
>   `gulp run-local`

    You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

>   `[Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:xxxx`
>    `pokebot>`

* Talk to pokebot
>   `pokebot> pokebot help`


## Using a local postgres install
* [Install postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/)

* Log in as root
>	`sudo -u postgres psql`

* Make a new user and database for Pokebot
>	`postgres=#	CREATE USER pokebot CREATEDB pokebot CREATEUSER PASSWORD 'oak';`

* Exit and log back in as pokebot:

>	`postgres=#	\q`

>	`psql -h localhost -U pokebot`

## Extra Configuration

A few scripts (including some installed by default) require environment
variables to be set as a simple form of configuration.

Each script should have a commented header which contains a "Configuration"
section that explains which values it requires to be placed in which variable.
When you have lots of scripts installed this process can be quite labour
intensive. The following shell command can be used as a stop gap until an
easier way to do this has been implemented.
```
    grep -o 'hubot-[a-z0-9_-]\+' external-scripts.json | \
      xargs -n1 -I {} sh -c 'sed -n "/^# Configuration/,/^#$/ s/^/{} /p" \
          $(find node_modules/{}/ -name "*.coffee")' | \
        awk -F '#' '{ printf "%-25s %s\n", $1, $2 }'
```
How to set environment variables will be specific to your operating system.
Rather than recreate the various methods and best practices in achieving this,
it's suggested that you search for a dedicated guide focused on your OS.
